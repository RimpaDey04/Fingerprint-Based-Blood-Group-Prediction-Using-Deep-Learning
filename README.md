# Fingerprint-Based-Blood-Group-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Blood group identification plays a crucial role in healthcare, especially during emergency medical situations. Traditional blood group detection methods are invasive, time-consuming, and require laboratory facilities. This project proposes a **non-invasive and automated approach** to predict human blood groups using **fingerprint images** and **deep learning techniques**.

The system utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to learn complex fingerprint patterns and classify them into different blood group categories. The proposed approach is experimental and intended for research and academic purposes only.
